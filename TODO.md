# This is a list of todos and ideas

- [x] #10 - output and roadmap.yml should be in separate outside roadmap-folders 
    - [x] As a good first stept it would be helpfull to read some directories in a given template-path
        - Read every folder/roadmap.* as a starting point for a given template
        - the type is the templates-folder-name
        - then render the found template and output in given output-path
        - the final suffix is derived from template suffix
    - [x] A second good step would be to pack everything in roadmap.py in functional parts
    - [x] Third step would be to add some logic for argument handling
        - if there are some arguments, then they will take precedence over static config
- [ ] #18 - timeline: group by same dates
- [ ] #16 - make a connection between keyresults and milestones
- [ ] #14 - add a date to keyresults
- [ ] #13 - add involved teams for keyresults
- [x] #4 - Support for project logo
    Logo must be placed where roadmap.yml lives
    it is copied during template processing
