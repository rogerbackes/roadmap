# This is a list of todos and ideas

- [ ] #10 - output and roadmap.yml should be in separate outside roadmap-folders 
    - As a good first stept it would be helpfull to read some directories in a given template-path
        - Read every folder/roadmap.* as a starting point for a given template
        - the type is the templates-folder-name
        - then render the found template and output in given output-path
        - the final suffix is derived from template suffix
        - if there is more than one template for a given suffix, add template-type  as a suffix before the final suffix
- [ ] #18 - timeline: group by same dates
- [ ] #16 - make a connection between keyresults and milestones
- [ ] #14 - add a date to keyresults
- [ ] #13 - add involved teams for keyresults
- [ ] #4 - Support for project logo
